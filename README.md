## Motivation

I was motivated to practice React with TypeScript for the front end and to learn Dexie.js and Zustand. The goal was to create an application similar to [Fresha](https://www.fresha.com/) with some of its features.

## Features

- Create/Read/Update/Delete an appointment/client/expert/service
- Resource scheduling for expert assignments
- Drag and drop appointments
- Resize appointments to change their duration
- Multiple calendar views: month, week, day, agenda

## What I've used / learned

- Dexie.js
- React
- TypeScript
- react-big-calendar
- react-hook-form
- zod validation
- TailwindCSS
- PrimeReact
- react-toastify
